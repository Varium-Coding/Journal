        <h3>Day 1 - Dot Notation</h3>
        <p>On the first day we learned how Dot Notation worked in JS, how to utilize node to run scripts in JS E.G console.log("What am i?") how to utilize libraries such as E.G Math console.log(math.random())</p>
        <h3>Day 2 - Variable Operators</h3>
        <p>On the second day, we learned how to utilize Variable Operaters such as Arithmetic Operators +, -, /, *, %, ++ etc.  Assignment operators such as =, *=,/=,++ and more!</p>
        <h3>Day 3 - IfElse + Comparison Operators</h3>
        <p>On the third day, we learned how to utilize IfElse such as the picture shown, and utilize Comparison operators in code such as ===, >,<,>=,<=</p>

    <h3>Day 4 - Loops</h3>
    <p>On the fourth day of GCE my teacher gave to me, Loops. They can be utilized in a number of ways, you can make them loop to make multiplication tables, you can use them as an age verification system. You're imagination is the limit!</p>
    <h3> Day 5 - Functions</h3>
    <p>On the fith day we were shown how to use Functions to clean up our code, rather than having long running lines of code or 15 lines non-connected. You can use functions as a little box to put everything prior learned into, so in the future you can call on it speciifcally to be ran or obtain specific part of the code</p>
