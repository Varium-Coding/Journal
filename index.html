<h2> About Me </h2>
<p>I am learning to code, wading through the waters and finding my way.</p>
<p>I am 26, from england and i enjoy playing games with friends and family. I also enjoy Music and going to concerts of bands such as Electric Callboy</p>
<p>I've played varying games since i was around 5, and have settled on MMO's as my primary game type. Currently I operate in a high-ranking guild playing Classic WoW(Wotlk + SoD)</p>
<p>Throughout this journal i'll be trying to show what it is i've learnt and show how its helped me progress as a developer!</p>

<p>I very much enjoy how coding makes me think logically, and has a ebb and flow to it that just makes sense and challenges me on a day to day basis.</p>
<p>Hopefully you will enjoy my journal and maybe learn a thing or two from it. I know i did while progressing through it.</p>
